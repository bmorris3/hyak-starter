# hyak-starter

Here's an in-developement set of requirements for starting runs with [emcee](https://github.com/dfm/emcee) on UW's [Hyak](http://www.washington.edu/itconnect/research/hpc/) supercomputing facility.

The example emcee script comes from [emcee/examples/line.py](https://github.com/dfm/emcee/blob/master/examples/line.py). 

Requires emcee, numpy, scipy, and optionally [corner](https://github.com/dfm/corner.py) and matplotlib.
